# Setup
Must pip install flask and request  
Set up flask environment: In my case, I used VSCode - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask  
Once that is done, make sure all the files and folders are within the virtual environment (.venv)  

# News Automation

It returns that latest news from user input search query and returns the title, description, link, and date on the webpage
Note: The API searches news articles for specific keywords or phrases present in the news title, content, URL, meta keywords and meta description.
