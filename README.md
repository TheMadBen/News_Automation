# Setup
Must pip install flask and request  
Set up flask environment: In my case, I used VSCode - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask  
Once that is done, make sure all the files and folders are within the virtual environment (.venv) 
py -m flask run then follow the link on local host port 5000 to work the web application

It returns that latest news from user input search query and returns the title, description, link, and date on the webpage  
Note: The API searches news articles for specific keywords or phrases present in the news title, content, URL, meta keywords and meta description.
