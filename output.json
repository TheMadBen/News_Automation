Photo by Miguel Gutierrez Jr., CalMatters (AP) \u2014 Unions representing 85,000 health care workers have reached a tentative agreement with industry giant Kaiser Permanente following a strike over wages and staffing levels, the parties announced Friday. The deal includes setting minimum hourly wages at $25 in California, where most of Kaiser\u2019s facilities are located, and $23 in other states. Workers will also see a 21% wage increase over four years. The ratification process is scheduled to begin next week. Both sides said they prioritized patient health care during their talks. Steve Shields, Kaiser\u2019s senior vice president of labor relations, said the deal will not effect rates. The three-day strike last week involving 75,000 workers in multiple states officially ended last Saturday and workers returned to their jobs in Oakland, California-based Kaiser\u2019s hospitals and clinics that serve nearly 13 million Americans. Union members said understaffing is boosting the hospital system\u2019s profits but hurting patients, and executives had been bargaining in bad faith during negotiations. \u201cMillions of Americans are safer today because tens of thousands of dedicated healthcare workers fought for and won the critical resources they need and that patients need,\u201d said Caroline Lucas, executive director of the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions, in a statement Friday. \u201cThis historic agreement will set a higher standard for the healthcare industry nationwide.\u201d The tentative agreement also includes protective terms around subcontracting and outsourcing, as well as initiatives to invest in the current workforce and address the staffing crisis. The workers\u2019 last contract was negotiated in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cWe have an interest in helping build the health care workforce of the future,\u201d Shields said during a news briefing Friday with both sides. President Joe Biden applauded the tentative deal in a statement Friday, echoing his support for the health care unions. The president last month joined picketing United Auto Workers in Michigan on the 12th day of their strike against major carmakers, becoming the first known sitting president in U.S. history to join an active picket line. \u201cWe owe a tremendous debt to health care workers and the hard-working men and women who make their work possible,\u201d Biden said Friday in a statement. \u201cHealth care workers and support staff kept our hospitals \u2013 and our nation \u2013 going during the dark months of the pandemic. They had our backs during one of our nation\u2019s toughest times. We must continue to have theirs.\u201d Acting U.S. Labor Secretary Julie Su participated in the negotiation sessions. The Kaiser strike for three days in California, as well as in Colorado, Oregon and Washington was a last resort after the health system\u2019s executives ignored the short-staffing crisis worsened by the coronavirus pandemic, union officials said. The coalition had given the company notice that another strike from Nov. 1 to Nov. 8 was possible and the Oct. 31 expiration of a contract covering the Seattle area would enable another 3,000 workers to join picket lines. Their goal was to bring the problems to the public\u2019s consciousness for support, according to the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions. Some 180 workers from facilities in Virginia and Washington, D.C., also picketed but only on Wednesday. The strikers include licensed vocational nurses, home health aides and ultrasound sonographers, as well as technicians in the radiology, X-ray, surgical, pharmacy and emergency departments. \u201cNo health care worker wants to go on strike,\u201d Lucas said Thursday. \u201cI hope that the last few days have helped escalate this issue.\u201d The company warned the work stoppage could cause delays in people getting appointments and scheduling non-urgent procedures. Unions representing Kaiser workers in August asked for a $25 hourly minimum wage, as well as increases of 7% each year in the first two years and 6.25% each year in the two years afterward. Kaiser, which turned a $2.1 billion profit for the quarter, said in a statement last week that it proposed minimum hourly wages between $21 and $23 depending on the location. The company said it also completed hiring 10,000 more people, adding to the 51,000 workers the hospital system has brought on board since 2022. ___ An earlier version of this report incorrectly said the unions represent 75,000 workers instead of 85,000.

            "content": "(AP) \u2014 Large-scale clean energy projects from Pennsylvania to California have been selected by the Biden administration for a $7 billion program to kickstart development and production of hydrogen fuel, a key component of President Joe Biden\u2019s agenda to slow climate change. His goal is to establish seven regional hydrogen hubs to help replace fossil fuels such as coal and oil with cleaner-burning hydrogen as an energy source for vehicles, manufacturing and generating electricity. Biden is expected to make the official announcement during an economic-themed visit to Philadelphia on Friday. The White House calls clean hydrogen \u201cessential to achieving the president\u2019s vision of a strong clean energy economy\u201d and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. by 2050. \u201cAs a clean fuel, hydrogen complements the role played by other clean energy sources, like wind and solar, to help the U.S. reduce emissions in energy-intensive sectors of the economy: steel and cement production, heavy-duty transportation, and shipping,\u201d the White House said in a statement. The seven hubs, which include projects in 16 states, will spur more than $40 billion in private investment and create tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, the White House said, including many high-paying union jobs. There were 23 finalists for the hydrogen fuel program. The projects selected are based in California, Washington, Minnesota, Texas, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Illinois. All but the California and Texas hubs include projects in multiple states. Pennsylvania has projects in two separate hubs. The infrastructure law Biden signed in 2021 included billions of dollars to develop so-called clean hydrogen, a technology that industry and clean-energy advocates have long pushed as a way to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions produced by fossil fuels. Some environmentalists call hydrogen a false solution because it frequently relies on natural gas or other fossil fuels as feedstocks. Energy companies say fossil fuels can serve as feedstocks if the projects capture the carbon dioxide produced and keep it out of the atmosphere, a technology that has yet to be produced at commercial scale. States and businesses have been competing for federal dollars in the new Energy Department program, which will create regional networks of hydrogen producers, consumers and infrastructure. The intent is to accelerate the availability and use of the colorless, odorless gas that already powers some vehicles and trains. Among those selected were the Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub, based in West Virginia, and the Philadelphia-based Mid-Atlantic Clean Hydrogen Hub. Pennsylvania, a battleground state of the highest importance to the Democratic president in next year\u2019s election, is in line to benefit from both projects. Biden has made Philadelphia a regular stop for both official and campaign events, and partners in the proposed Philadelphia-area hub have labor unions that are key Biden supporters. The West Virginia-based hub includes major Pittsburgh-based natural gas companies that are active in the region\u2019s prolific Marcellus Shale reservoir, including natural gas producer EQT Corp. that expects its gas to flow through the controversial Mountain Valley Pipeline in West Virginia and Virginia. Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat who muscled approval of the $6.6 billion pipeline through Congress in an unusual agreement with the White House this year, hailed the Appalachian hub. \u201cThis means West Virginia will be the new epicenter of hydrogen in the United States of America,\u201d he said of the hub, which will receive up to $925 million in federal spending. \u201cWest Virginia will be on the leading edge of building out the new hydrogen market while bringing good-paying jobs and new economic opportunity to the state.\u201d The Appalachian hub will extend to Ohio and includes a $1.6 billion facility under construction in northern Pennsylvania that is working to produce near-zero emissions hydrogen from natural gas. \u201cThis is a big, big deal for \u2026 Appalachia in particular, because these facilities are all based in areas where coal was king,\u201d said Perry Babb, president of KeyState, an owner and developer of the Pennsylvania site. Partners in the Appalachian hub say it could produce hydrogen from methane using heat, steam and pressure while capturing the carbon dioxide it would generate. The Mid-Atlantic hub, which includes New Jersey and Delaware, will receive $750 million and will make hydrogen through electrolysis \u2014 splitting water molecules using renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, as well as nuclear power. The two largest projects are in California and Texas and will each receive up to $1.2 billon. The Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems in California will produce hydrogen from renewable energy and biomass. The project is intended to provide a blueprint for decarbonizing public transportation, heavy duty trucking and port operations \u2014 key emissions drivers in the state and major sources of air pollution. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said most people focus on rooftop solar panels or electric vehicles when they think about clean energy, \u201cbut you\u2019ve got these heavy, heavy industries in the ports, aviation, shipping and agriculture, and these large power plants, cement and steel plants\u201d that produce huge amounts of carbon pollution. In order to achieve state and U.S. climate goals, \u201cwe have to address these intensive industries,\u201d Newsom said at a news conference Friday. The Gulf Coast Hydrogen Hub will be centered in Houston, long the energy capital of the U.S., and plans large-scale hydrogen production from both natural gas and renewables. \u201cThis historic investment will further cement Texas\u2019 position as the national leader in energy and hydrogen production,\u201d said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. The Minnesota-based Heartland hub, which includes projects in North and South Dakota, will receive $925 million as it seeks to decarbonize fertilizer used in agriculture and advance use of clean hydrogen in electric generation and for cold climate space heating. It also plans to offer equity ownership to tribal communities and local farmers. The Midwest hub in Illinois, Indiana and Michigan will receive up to $1 billion and will use hydrogen in steel and glass production, power generation, heavy-duty transportation and sustainable aviation fuel. The hub plans to use renewable energy, natural gas and nuclear energy. The Pacific Northwest hub, based in eastern Washington, will extend to Oregon and Montana and will use hydropower and other renewable resources to produce clean hydrogen. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., called the $1 billion hub \u201cgreat news for the Pacific Northwest,\u201d adding that it will create thousands of jobs and \u201cmake sure that Washington plays a leading role in growing the green hydrogen economy.\u201d Nearly every state had joined at least one proposed hub, and many have been working together, hoping to reap the economic development and thousands of jobs they would bring. Big fossil fuel companies, renewable energy developers and researchers in university and government labs are involved, too. Environmental groups are skeptical, arguing that while hydrogen is a clean-burning source of power, it takes a great deal of energy to produce. When it\u2019s made with electricity from coal or natural gas, it has a bigger carbon footprint than simply burning the source fuel. \u201cWe need strong guardrails to ensure that U.S. hydrogen does not create an emissions mess, and that we are not subsidizing hydrogen that is clean in name only,\u201d said Erik Kamrath, federal hydrogen advocate at Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. Anna Menke, senior hydrogen hubs manager at Clean Air Task Force, another environmental group, called the new hubs \u201ca critical first step\u201d to reduce emissions from carbon-intensive industries such as ammonia production for fertilizers and petrochemicals used in refining. New uses of hydrogen in sectors such as heavy-duty trucking, shipping and aviation are potential game changers, she said. \u201cThe hydrogen hubs program can provide a variety of community and climate benefits, and we must ensure the program delivers on these promises.\u201d ___ Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

            "description": "The \"Frasier\" revival is the latest show to remind us that digging up the past isn't always golden",
            "content": "-- Shares Facebook Twitter Reddit Email Television\u2019s Memory Lane has as many versions as there are Atlanta streets named Peachtree, with only a few of those causeways seeing heavy traffic. Avenues memorializing \u201c Frasier \u201d may not be among them , despite Kelsey Grammer's \u201cCheers\u201d-spinoff being a ratings force in its day, snagging five consecutive years\u2019 worth of best comedy Emmys and running for 11 seasons. It also ended well in 2004, satisfying longtime viewers by leaving its characters in good places, especially Dr. Frasier Crane, who had long been unlucky in love and finally found a love match in Laura Linney\u2019s Charlotte. Our last glimpse of Frasier shows him choosing Charlotte over a TV show in a bigger market than his longtime home Seattle and choosing Chicago over Seattle or San Francisco \u2014 a flawlessly symmetric bow on a story that began long ago in Boston. Where\u2019s the value in unpacking that? Related The totally real \"Frasier\" reboot episode guide Networks are perpetually giddy to answer that question. If \u201c Will & Grace \u201d can crawl out of the grave and \u201cThat \u201870s Show\u201d can return as \u201c That \u201890s Show ,\u201d there's no reason to assume the good doctor is immune to the affliction we'll call revivalitis. But there\u2019s a difference between breathing new life into a three-decade-old title and whatever awkward necromancy unnaturally extending the life of \u201cFrasier\u201d achieves without adding fresh layers to its eponymous figure. Remember how terrific \u201c Murphy Brown \u201d was for 10 seasons before it ended in 1998? What did you think of season 11 , which ran in 2019? (Yes, there was season 11.) This revivalitis outbreak may not be so forgettable, but it does rely on our affection for resuming familiar patterns. We rejoin our attentive therapist on his way to Paris, which he precedes with a stop in Boston to visit his son, Freddy (Jack Cutmore-Scott), last seen dutifully following the nerd map written into his DNA. Since then, Freddy ditched his parent-approved Harvard undergraduate track to become a firefighter \u2014 Mr. July on his department\u2019s calendar, in fact \u2014 thereby disappointing his father. This revivalitis outbreak may not be so forgettable, but it does rely on our affection for resuming familiar patterns. Before we get into that dynamic, you may be wondering why the show is airing on Paramount+ instead of NBC or Peacock . While the original series premiered on NBC, \u201cFrasier\u201d was produced by Paramount, which now has a streaming service to feed. Thus, Grammer\u2019s return to the field of psychiatry in some respect was probably inevitable. As for the ensemble\u2019s other regulars, David Hyde Pierce opted to leave Niles Crane packed in amber. John Mahoney, who played Frasier\u2019s father Martin, died in 2018. Peri Gilpin is set to return as Frasier\u2019s no-nonsense Seattle producer Roz, but by the time it happens, we may wonder what purpose it serves beyond reminding us that this new show has threads of connection to the old. (Bebe Neuwirth, who plays Freddy\u2019s mother and Frasier\u2019s ex Lilith, is also scheduled to drop by.) But we\u2019re already getting these through the characters showrunners Joe Cristalli and Chris Harris have arranged around Frasier, which are basically new versions of the old gang. Since Freddy and Frasier are estranged, and with Harvard in need of his magnificent insight and wit, Frasier decides to return to Beantown, triumphant. In the 19 years since we last saw him, Frasier became the host of a successful TV talk show, making him as recognizable Dr. Phil, minus the abusive trauma theater. Toks Olagundoye as Olivia, Kelsey Grammer as Frasier Crane and Nicholas Lyndhurst as Alan in \"Frasier\" (Chris Haston/Paramount+) Joining Harvard\u2019s faculty alongside his old friend, Alan Cornwall (Nicholas Lyndhurst), and Olivia Finch (Toks Olagundoye), the head of Harvard\u2019s psychology department, allows him to be a better father to his son and remove whatever tarnish his talk show left on his intellectual credibility. The new \u201cFrasier\u201d moves to the same structural rhythms as the old \u201cFrasier,\u201d which would be a comfort if we didn\u2019t already have more than a decade\u2019s worth of the character\u2019s adventures to revisit whether via Paramount+ or Hallmark , where it lingers on by way of a syndicated afterlife. But what's the value of recreating the same dynamics in the namesake character\u2019s life without establishing new challenges for him? The revival forces us to ask that question, especially in the creaky two episodes currently streaming, directed by the legendary James Burrows. Before you watch those, you may want to revisit the two-part 2004 finale. We need your help to stay independent Subscribe today to support Salon's progressive journalism Provided you remember \u201cFrasier,\u201d you might not need to. Crashing the Crane brothers\u2019 highbrow sensibilities against their humble origins is the show\u2019s comedic fuel, of which we\u2019re constantly reminded in the first go-round by Martin, a retired cop, and Martin\u2019s caretaker, Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves). It's also the source of Frasier\u2019s winning vulnerability, distilled by Grammer into a cocktail of haughty sangfroid, grumpiness and keen loneliness. Frasier injected a similar energy into \u201cCheers\u201d once he joined that cast in its third season. But when \u201cFrasier\u201d creators David Angell, Peter Casey and David Lee spun him off from said classic, they didn\u2019t recycle the used clay that was Sam, Norm, Cliff, Woody and so on into Seattle counterparts. Cristalli and Harris didn't follow that example. Niles\u2019 son, David (Anders Keith), is essentially a combination of Niles and Martin\u2019s wire-haired Jack Russell terrier Eddie instead of Niles and Daphne. He's all elbows, left feet and tail-wagging eagerness. Niles' sensible half shows up in Lyndhurst\u2019s Alan, Frasier\u2019s confidante providing the adult insight David lacks. Jack Cutmore-Scott as Freddy Crane and Jess Salgueiro as Eve in \"Frasier\" (Paramount+Chris Haston/Paramount+) Jess Salgueiro\u2019s Eve, Freddy's roommate, takes over Leeves\u2019 dual purpose as a live-in reality check, with Olagundoye\u2019s Olivia on Roz duty, which is to say she\u2019s attractive and capable of wrestling Alan and Frasier into submission. All told, it\u2019s the same show with one character in common who, like us, is looking and feeling older, except he\u2019s back in Boston now, where the struggles he once had with his working-class dad resume with his working-class son. Every Seattle resident will tell you the dreamy view from Frasier\u2019s condo in those classic episodes is as non-existent as Caf\u00e9 Nervosa. The producers\u2019 efforts to tip their hat to the place resulted in some comedic mispronunciations of locales like Lake Chelan . It\u2019s much easier to cultivate the show\u2019s Ivy League bona fides by dropping lines such as, \u201cExplain it to me like I\u2019m a student at Tufts.\u201d It didn\u2019t matter if the cast and writers didn\u2019t quite nail Seattle as a character because the action revolved around Frasier and what he represented, especially as a figure straddling the end of the Clinton Era and the first four years of George W. Bush\u2019s presidency. Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter , Crash Course. Frasier was and is the embodiment of the wine-swilling coastal elite clowned and vilified by conservatives from Rush Limbaugh to every Fox News pundit one can name. He drove a BMW, not a Volvo (still, the stereotype fits). Grammer is a lifelong Republican, but regardless of one\u2019s politics, everyone laughed with and at his fussy therapist, and the empathy he engendered was nearly ubiquitous. Both then and now, the scripts allow for stillness, letting the audience marinate in a character\u2019s sensitive insights and confessions between the zingers. Like Frasier\u2019s profession, this strategy is portable. But the audience has changed enough for the past version of the show to seem of its time even as the character remains timeless. The \u201cFrasier\u201d revival acknowledges its therapists\u2019 part in our modern obsession with fame and fortune in the third episode, where we receive a glimpse of where his show began \u2014 as a serious healing endeavor \u2014 versus the audience-pandering vaudeville act it became in its final seasons. The \u201cFrasier\u201d revival acknowledges its therapists\u2019 part in our modern obsession with fame and fortune. Frasier Crane is a man divided between his need for validation and his urge for refinement and solitude. Perhaps the most touching part of the 2004 finale arrives when Frasier closes the door on a man who has removed Martin\u2019s beaten-up old lounger. He places his beloved Eames chair in its spot, sits down and quietly listens to the rainfall exactly where he\u2019s always wanted to be. A beat after we experience this satisfaction with him, Frasier makes a phone call we\u2019re made to believe is launching his next chapter \u2014 in a new city, and with the fresh challenge of mounting a TV show. We can only imagine the possibilities that could have emerged from depicting the character\u2019s steadfast standards butting against the crass, psychologically draining demands of a viewership-driven business. Instead, we\u2019re invited to settle for a version of history repeating itself. Who knows how many people want to go down that road again?

            "content": "Loki Season 2 Episode 2 ends with one of Marvel's needle drop moments. The song that plays at the end of Loki Season 2 Episode 2 is Janis Joplin's \"Kozmic Blues.\" Released in 1969, the track sees Joplin breaking away from Big Brother and the Holding Company. That little detail probably helps explain why the Loki team chose this song to have Sylvie looking out into the distance with. \"Kozmic Blues\" also works double duties as the lyrics are mostly about time and regret. Sylvie made some big choices at the end of Loki Season 1 and now she's had some time to think about the future Loki warned about. In \"Kozmic Blues,\" Joplin is meditating on why people drift apart. The lyrics include statements like, \"Time keeps moving on / friends, they turn away. / I keep moving on / But I never found out why.\" This sentiment seems to match up pretty well with Loki and Sylvie's dynamic after the events of Loki Season 1. She killed He Who Remains and pushed her fellow Trickster God away. Now, cosmic forces are pulling them back together again . In that moment, it looks like Sylvie is contemplating walking away from the TVA again after their failure to protect branched timelines. What she will choose is impossible to know. Loki Returns For Season 2 (Photo: Marvel Entertainment) For Marvel Studios, Loki has been a constant bright spot. So, when the time for Season 2 came around, there was no question that a lot of the band was going to reunite. ComicBook.com spoke to Christine Wada, costume designer for Loki , about the allure of a trip back to the TVA on Disney+ . \"First of all, the story really never ended in Season One,\" Wada told us. \"So I had to complete the journey with the team. But of course, I really do think that this team and this job is just incredibly special. I think that probably starts from the pages and Tom [Hiddleston] and just the dedication everybody has to building this story and the quirkiness of it ... there was no way I couldn't. I knew it wasn't going to be the exact same thing. I knew it would be just expanding on the original vision. I mean, I think the best way to describe it is, I never really thought that this would be Season Two. I've just seen it as Part Two.\" Where Can You Get More Loki Season 2? \" Marvel Studios fan-favorite Tom Hiddleston stars in Loki Season 2, returning as the titular God of Mischief for another round of time-traveling hijinx on Disney+ on October 6th. Loki is once again joined by Mobius ( Owen Wilson ) as the two attempt to keep the timelines intact. After the events of Season 1 saw his variant Sylvie (Sophia Di Martino) kill He Who Remains and unleash the wrath of Kang the Conqueror upon the Multiverse, Loki must once again embark on an adventure to keep reality from collapsing.\" \"Loki was last seen in the post-credits scene of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania , where he and Mobius were keeping tabs on one of Kang's mysterious variants. Loki Season 2 will continue the story of the Multiverse Saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe .\" ComicBook.com 's podcast Phase Zero will be recording live episodes every week following Loki season 2's new episodes on Disney+.

            "content": "House Republicans continue to attempt to find consensus in the search for a new Speaker, a position that puts the member third in line to the presidency, after ousting Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) from the post last week. And now a new figure has emerged. Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.) has thrown his hat into the race. Republicans are again huddling behind closed doors Friday, trying to save themselves from an embarrassing splintering seen during the January marathon speaker votes. Scott is up against House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who has been spearheading the impeachment inquiry into President Biden. \u201cWe are in Washington to legislate, and I want to lead a House that functions in the best interest of the American people,\u201d Scott his Speaker race announcement. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), who initially won the GOP nomination earlier this week, withdrew from the race late Thursday night after it appeared he couldn\u2019t get the 217 votes needed to secure the position. It\u2019s unclear when an eventual vote will happen, as members from both sides are absent Friday. House business is essentially frozen until a new Speaker is selected, as a government shutdown looms and critical aid for Israel and Ukraine is sought. The Senate has been out this week, waiting on word from the House that things will be moving forward. McCarthy\u2019s removal last week was the first time that a Speaker has been voted out and it came just months after another historic feat: It took 15 rounds of voting before he secured the gavel after behind-the-scenes deals with skeptical Republicans. So who is Austin Scott? Scott, who was GOP freshmen class president for the 112th Congress, is in his seventh term in the House, representing Georgia\u2019s deeply Republican 8th Congressional District in the south-central portion of the state. The district voted for former President Trump in both the 2016 and 2020 elections. A native of Augusta, Ga., Scott, 53, was elected to the Georgia State House when he was 26, after graduating from the University of Georgia with a degree in risk management and insurance. Scott\u2019s district has two Air Force bases: Moody and Robins, so he\u2019s been a pro-military and pro-defense spending advocate. In addition to the Armed Services Committee, he\u2019s a member of the Agriculture and Intelligence committees. With a very slim majority in the House, many have called on Republicans to find a leader who can work across the aisle and with the Democratic leadership in the Senate and Biden in the White House. Scott helped Georgia Democrats in the effort to remove the Confederate battle emblem from the state flag in 2001, bucking the Republican Party line. But Scott opposes abortion and same-sex marriage and has called for federal bans on both. He also challenged the 2020 election of Biden over Trump. Just before Trump left office and after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, Scott lambasted Democrats. \u201cMake no mistake about it, these calls for President Trump\u2019s removal would not be happening without the leader of the Democratic Party, President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s, support,\u201d he said in a statement at the time. \u201cSpeaker Pelosi and liberal Democrats seek to further divide our nation rather than work towards unity \u2013 unity that many on both sides of the aisle have stated is critical for our country at this time. I voted NO on the 25th Amendment resolution and the article of impeachment against President Trump.\u201d \u201cI think there are a lot of congressmen who are willing to be one-term congressmen,\u201d Scott added, \u201cand I say that as a compliment.\u201d",

            "description": "With the House narrowly split 221-212, with two vacancies, any nominee can lose just a few Republicans before they fail to reach the 217 majority needed in the face of opposition from Democrats who will most certainly back their own leader, New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries.",
            "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Increasingly desperate Republicans convened behind closed doors again Friday as the endless search for a House speaker drags deeper into a second week leaving the GOP majority spiraling into chaos for the foreseeable future. Attention swiftly turned to Rep. Jim Jordan, the Trump-allied Judiciary Committee chairman and founder of the hardline Freedom Caucus as the next potential candidate after Majority Leader Steve Scalise abruptly ended his bid when it became clear hardline holdouts refused to back him. But not all Republicans want to see Jordan as speaker, second in line to the presidency. Overwhelmed and exhausted, anxious GOP lawmakers worry their House majority is being frittered away to countless rounds of infighting over rules, personalities and direction of the GOP. \u201cSomeone said \u2018You know, you could put Jesus Christ up for Speaker of the House, and he still wouldn\u2019t get 217,\u201d said Rep. Mark Alford, R-Mo., about the number needed to win a floor vote. Next steps are uncertain as the House is essentially closed while the Republican majority is expected to convene again in the afternoon for the internal nominating speeches to elect a speaker after ousting Kevin McCarthy from the job. \u201cI think Jordan would do a great job,\u201d said McCarthy, whose own allies are trying to reinstate him as speaker. \u201cWe got to get this back on track.\u201d Jordan and his backers instantly revived calls for party members to get behind the Ohio Republican. Backed by Trump, the Republican frontrunner to challenge Joe Biden in 2024, Jordan had nominally dropped out of the race he initially lost to Scalise, 113-99, during internal balloting at the start of the week. \u201cMake him the speaker. Do it tonight,\u201d said Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind. \u201cHe\u2019s the only one who can unite our party.\u201d Jordan also received an important nod Friday from the Republican party\u2019s campaign chairman, Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., who made an attempt to unify the fighting factions. \u201cRemoving Speaker Kevin McCarthy was a mistake,\u201d Hudson wrote on social media, saying the party finds itself at a crossroads also blocking Scalise. \u201cWe must unite around one leader.\u201d Heading into the morning meeting, Jordan said: \u201cI feel real good.\u201d While the firebrand Jordan has a long list of detractors who started making their opposition known, Jordan\u2019s supporters said voting against Jordan during a public vote on the House floor would be tougher since he is so popular and well known among Trump voters. Other potential speaker choices were also being floated. Some Republicans proposed simply giving Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., who was appointed interim speaker pro tempore, greater authority to lead the House for some time. With the House narrowly split 221-212, with two vacancies, any nominee can lose just a few Republicans before they fail to reach the 217 majority needed in the face of opposition from Democrats who will most certainly back their own leader, New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries. Absences heading into the weekend could lower the majority threshold needed, or push the House floor vote for speaker into next week. Republicans said they were down about a dozen lawmakers as of midday Friday. No floor votes are scheduled as attendance thinned before the weekend. In announcing his decision to withdraw from the nomination, Scalise said late Thursday the Republican majority still has to come together and \u201copen up the House again. But clearly not everybody is there.\u201d Asked if he would throw his support behind Jordan, Scalise said, \u201cIt\u2019s got to be people that aren\u2019t doing it for themselves and their own personal interest.\u201d Scalise had been laboring to peel off more than 100 votes, mostly from those who backed Jordan. But many hard-liners taking their cues from Trump have dug in for a prolonged fight to replace McCarthy after his historic ouster from the job. The hold-outs argued that as majority leader, Scalise was no better choice, that he should be focusing on his health as he battles cancer and that he was not the leader they would support. The House closed late in the night, with lawmakers vowing to meet again early Friday. Handfuls of Republicans announced they were sticking with Jordan, McCarthy or someone other than Scalise \u2014 including Trump. The position as House speaker does not need to go to a member of Congress. Trump, the front-runner for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, repeatedly discussed Scalise\u2019s health during a radio interview that aired Thursday. \u201cWell, I like Steve. I like both of them very much. But the problem, you know, Steve is a man that is in serious trouble, from the standpoint of his cancer,\u201d Trump said on Fox News host Brian Kilmeade\u2019s radio show. Scalise has been diagnosed with a form of blood cancer known as multiple myeloma and is being treated, but has also said he was definitely up for the speaker\u2019s job. McCarthy said afterward that Scalise would remain as majority leader but had no other advice for his colleagues. Another California Republican Rep. Tom McClintock had introduced a motion to reinstate McCarthy during Friday\u2019s morning meeting, but it was tabled without enough support. \u201cI just told them, no, let\u2019s not do that,\u201d McCarthy said afterward. \u201cLet\u2019s walk through this and have an election.\u201d The House is entering its second week without a speaker and is essentially unable to function during a time of turmoil in the U.S. and wars overseas. The political pressure increasingly is on Republicans to reverse course, reassert majority control and govern in Congress. The situation is not fully different from the start of the year, when McCarthy faced a similar backlash from a different group of far-right holdouts who ultimately gave their votes to elect him speaker, then engineered his historic downfall. But the math this time is even more daunting, and the problematic political dynamic only worsening. Exasperated Democrats, who have been waiting for the Republican majority to recover from McCarthy\u2019s ouster, urged them to figure it out. \u201cThe House Democrats have continued to make clear that we are ready, willing and able to find a bipartisan path forward,\u201d he said, including doing away with the rule that allows a single lawmaker to force a vote against the speaker. \u201cBut we need traditional Republicans to break from the extremists and partner with us.\u201d",

            "description": "First-of-its-kind FEMA funding aims to update archaic building codes that leave millions of people exposed to climate-fueled hurricanes, floods and other extreme weather",
            "content": "Two houses are side by side. One is a crumpled mess of splintered wood and ripped insulation. The other stands perfectly intact. This image is one that increasingly pops up on news sites and social media after hurricanes, floods and climate-fueled disasters. An accompanying caption often emphasizes that the intact home was built with a hurricane-resistant roof and flood-resistant materials. Such images are enmeshed in a growing push to make buildings more resilient to climate impacts \u2014 an effort that a federal agency catapulted forward Thursday when it vowed to give every state up to $2 million next year to The unprecedented funding \u2014 from the Federal Emergency Management Agency \u2014 follows a series of reports showing that most local building codes are archaic and leave millions of people highly exposed to climate impacts. It also comes after President Joe Biden launched to help states and localities adopt the latest building codes. \u201cThis is the single largest investment ever at the federal level in support of hazard-resistant building codes,\u201d said Gabe Maser, senior vice president for government relations at the International Code Council, which publishes model building codes that local officials can adopt. \u201cIt sends an incredibly powerful message,\u201d Maser added. comes as some state legislatures, under pressure from builders, to adopt new building codes. New codes \u2014 often criticized as costly \u2014 typically have stronger construction standards and account for the latest effects of climate change. \u201cThe goal here is simple: Building codes save lives,\u201d said Victoria Salinas, FEMA's associate administrator for resilience. Salinas cited reports that partly blamed weak building codes and lax enforcement for the death of 56,000 people during an earthquake in Syria and Turkey in February. \u201cThere are plenty of places in the U.S. where we still have a long way to go,\u201d Salinas said. \u201cLess than 25 percent of municipalities have adopted the latest building code.\u201d FEMA is offering $2 million to every state and U.S. territory \u2014 if they apply for the money and have their applications approved. The agency also is offering a total of $25 million to tribal nations. When FEMA previously offered states annual grants for climate resilience, a few states never applied. Many others received only a portion of the available money. \u201cA lot of states are grudgingly accepting building codes,\u201d said Leslie Chapman-Henderson, president of the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes. \u201cThis is going to help facilitate those states or local governments that are maybe on the fence.\u201d \u201cThere was a lot of denial about this years ago,\u201d Chapman-Henderson added. \u201cThere\u2019s no rational argument against building codes.\u201d Reports in recent years have outlined the value of new building codes and the failure of states and localities to adopt them. A 2019 study by the showed that the adoption of new building codes is far more cost-effective at reducing disaster damage than other strategies, such as elevating flood-prone homes or providing federal grants. A found that 65 percent of U.S. counties and municipalities had outdated building codes that exposed residents to \u201ca dangerous, costly and unnecessarily high level of risk.\u201d In March, the agency released that gave 40 states and territories the lowest possible rating for the quality of their statewide building codes. \u201cThese reports keep coming out and are consistently finding that structures that are built to current codes or even codes that have been adopted in the last decade perform so much better than the structures around them,\u201d said the code council's Maser. Maser\u2019s nonprofit organization publishes model codes every three years for homes and commercial buildings through a collaborative process involving experts. The latest versions of the codes were released in 2021. States can spend the FEMA money on enhancing their existing codes, studying new codes or training employees in using codes. States can distribute their $2 million share to local agencies. FEMA is allocating the money as part of a larger grant program that will distribute $1 billion next year to states for projects that build resilience to disasters and climate impacts. Under the grant program, known as Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, states are allowed to seek money to improve building codes. But very few of the applications to FEMA sought money for that purpose, according to Salinas, the agency associate administrator. The lack of interest prompted FEMA to set aside $137 million of the grant funding for building codes. \u201cGiven the gap we have to close in the nation, that\u2019s why we\u2019re trying this approach,\u201d Salinas said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying different approaches to incentivize behavior and adoption.\u201d",
